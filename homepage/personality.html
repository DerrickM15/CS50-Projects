        <h1>Rory's Personality and Quirks</h1>
        <div class="container" id="personality-content">
            <p>Rory loves to play fetch more than anything. She would spend all day at the dog park, playing fetch if she could. When not playing fetch, Rory is very calm and well mannered. She enjoys watching the front door of the house and making sure the house stays safe.</p>
            <p>Rory adores her sisters Lyra and Coraline, the cat. She likes to sit as close to Coraline as possible, even though Coraline doesn't appreciate the close proximity as much as Rory. When she is with Lyra, she likes to share her toys and lick Lyra on the face.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Rory barks at people walking on the sidewalk outside the house, but she would never hurt anyone. I think she does this to keep the house safe. She also really doesn't like people on rollerblades.</p>
